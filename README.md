# Bash-Script-1

Create a Bash script that runs every Friday at 11 pm and does the following: 1. updates the server, 2. creates a new file with the line about how many packages can be upgraded that outputs to the screen (ex. x packages can be upgraded.). The file name should have the current date appended to it (e.g. update08.25.23.txt).

Your script should:

Have a heading with the purpose of the script, your name, and the date.
Have comments explaining the cronjob you set up to automatically run on Friday at 11 pm w/o user interaction
Have comments explaining what the commands are doing.
Have limited errors.
